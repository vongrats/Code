# Prison Break
This is a basic text adventure written in Python. This could be used as a template for a more complex project. 
The project wasin part inspireed by one of the original text adventure games named Zork.
*  It has the basic nsew directions, inventory (list) and rooms (dictionary) to navigate.
*  Dictionarys are used for room definitions.
*  There is a single monster that if present in the same room as the player is an immediate "GAME OVER man".
*  There is a verbose/brief room description toggle similar to the one found in Zork. Brief mode is for experianced players who are already familiar with the layout and don't want to see the extra flavor text.
